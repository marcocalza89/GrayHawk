NOTE: Before April 25th, 2025, there was a typo regarding the only spin-2 field.
      Namely, the second term of the potential, in the numerator, reported a DH instead of (DH)^2.
      I am grateful to Dr. Morgan H. Lynch for noticing and communicating it.      
      The version of the code now available correctly takes into account such quantity.
