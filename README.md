NOTE: Before April 25th, 2025, there was a typo in the code regarding the only spin-2 field. Namely, in the second term of the potential, in the numerator, it appeared DH instead of (DH)^2.
      I am grateful to Dr. Morgan H. Lynch for noticing and reporting it.      
      The version of the code now available correctly reports such quantity.
